                    <p class="text-muted mb-5">This is the privacy statement of CourtRun Legal Couriers (Pty) Ltd In this document, “we” or “us” refer to CourtRun Legal Couriers&nbsp;(Pty) Ltd. We are company number 2015/061471/07 registered in South Africa. Our registered office is at 37 Malta Road, Cosmo Business Park, Malibongwe Drive, Kya Sands, South Africa. This is a statement to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not. We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with the South African law. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. Here is a list of the information we collect from you, either through our web site or because you give it to us in some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:<br><br>1. BUSINESS AND PERSONAL INFORMATION<br><br>This includes basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details and also includes all information given to us in the course of your business and ours, such as information you give us in your capacity as our client. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. It is not used for any other purpose. We expect you to reciprocate this policy.<br>This information is used:<br>1.1. to provide you with the services which you request;<br>1.2. for verifying your identity for security purposes;<br>1.3. for marketing our services and products;<br>1.4. information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.<br>We keep information, which forms part of our business record for a minimum of five years. That is because we may need it in some way to support a claim or defence in court. That is also the period within which our tax collecting authorities may demand to know it.<br><br>2. YOUR DOMAIN NAME AND E-MAIL ADDRESS<br><br>This information is recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We shall not under any circumstances, divulge your e-mail address to any person who is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know, either generally or specifically. This information is used:<br>2.1. to correspond with you or deal with you as you expect;<br>2.2. in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;<br>2.3. to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;<br>2.4. to tell you about other of our services or services of sister web sites.<br><br>3. INFORMATION YOU POST ON OUR WEBSITE<br><br>Information you send to us by posting to a forum or blog or in your advertisement, is stored on our servers. We do not specifically use that information except to allow it to be read, but you will see in our terms and conditions that we reserve a right to use it in any way we decide.<br><br>4. WEBSITE USAGE INFORMATION<br><br>We may use software embedded in our website (such as JavaScript) to collect information about pages you view and how you have reached them, what you do when you visit a page, the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing content to you. We do not presently associate such information with an identifiable person.<br><br>5. FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO YOUR CREDIT CARDS<br><br>This information is never taken by us either through our website or otherwise. At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of PayFast. That page may be dressed in our “livery”, but it is not controlled by us. Our staff and contractors never have access to it.<br><br>6. NOTE ON PADLOCK SYMBOLS AND OTHER TRUST MARKS<br><br>Many companies offer certification and an icon or other small graphic to prove to site visitors that the site is safe. Some certify to a high level of safety. Others are more concerned to take our money than to provide a useful service. We do not handle information about your credit card so do not subscribe to any such service.<br><br>7. CREDIT REFERENCE<br><br>To assist in combating fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies, so far as it relates to clients or customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.<br><br>8. INFORMATION WE OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES<br><br>Although we do not disclose your personal information to any third party (except as set out in this notice), we do receive data which is indirectly made up from your personal information, from software services such as Google Analytics and others. No such information is identifiable to you.<br><br>9. CONTENT YOU PROVIDE TO US WITH A VIEW TO BE USED BY THIRD PARTY<br><br>If you provide information to us with a view to it being read, copied, downloaded or used by other people, we accept no responsibility for what that third party may do with it. It is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might see your information. If it is available to all the World, you have no control whatever as to how it is used.<br><br>10.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW<br><br>This confidentiality policy has been compiled so as to comply with the law of every jurisdiction in which we aim to do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your country, we should like to hear from you, but ultimately it is your choice as to whether you wish to use our website.<br><br>19.
